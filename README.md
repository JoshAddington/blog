This repo is a fork of https://github.com/JoshAddington/django_blog used for deploying the blog to OpenShift.

This a blogging platform that I created for myself using Django and PostGreSQL and deployed on Heroku initially, and then refactored for OpenShift deployment. The blog can be visited at JoshAddington.com

The openshift app contains the Django project settings.

The blog app contains the blog posts and root urls.

The projects app will handle the various data visualization projects that I'll be working on.

Projects will sometimes have their own apps, depending on how complex the needs of the visualization gets.
