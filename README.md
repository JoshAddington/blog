This repo is a fork of https://github.com/JoshAddington/django_blog used for deploying the blog to OpenShift.

This a blogging platform that I created for myself using Django and Postgres to deploy on Heroku initially, and then refactored for Amazon Web Services. The blog can be visited at JoshAddington.com

The mysite app contains the Django project settings.

The blog app contains the blog posts and root urls.

The projects app will handle posting the various data visualization projects that I'll be working on.

Projects will sometimes have their own apps, depending on how complex the needs of the visualization becomes.
